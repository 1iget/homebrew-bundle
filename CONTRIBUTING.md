## Contributing
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Add documentation if necessary.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
  * Your branch must pass tests: run `rake` or `rspec spec/{file or functionality you modified}_spec.rb`.
  * Your branch must pass style checking: run `brew style homebrew/bundle` if your working copy is tapped. If not, run `brew style .` and ignore "Use hash rockets syntax" warnings.
